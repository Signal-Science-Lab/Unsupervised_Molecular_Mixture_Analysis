# Project Description:
## Unsupervised identification of the constituents of 1000 molecular mixtures from the corresponding NMR spectra 

## File / folder description
- Converted_Data: this folder contains the NMR spectra of 74 small molecules used in the analysis
- Mixing_Elements: this folder contains the 20 NMR spectra used in creating the augmented dataset of 1000 mixed spectra
- new_library.csv: a spectral library containing wavelet packet transform (WPT) shift NMR spectra for the individual molecules
- new_mix_description.csv: chemical composition corresponding to the 1000 mixed spectra
- final_prediction.csv: summary of predictions for the chemical compositions of the molecular mixtures
